A Python-based voice assistant that can open apps, play songs, and fetch Wikipedia summaries.
Nova – A Python-based Voice Assistant 🎙️🤖
Nova is a simple yet powerful voice assistant built with Python. It can open popular websites, play songs on YouTube, fetch quick information from Wikipedia, and even close applications through voice commands. Designed to work with a wake word (“Nova”), this project demonstrates the integration of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and automation libraries in Python.

1.Project Development Process

Here’s how I built **Nova – A Python Voice Assistant** step by step:

### 1. Setup Environment
- Installed Python 3.x  
- Installed required libraries:
  
  pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia pyaudio


 🔹 Tech Stack 
speech_recognition (for voice input)

pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)

pywhatkit (for YouTube automation)

wikipedia (for fetching information)

os & webbrowser (for system tasks)

pyaudio (for microphone access)


🔹 Features

🌐 Open and close websites (Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook)

🎶 Play songs on YouTube using voice commands

📖 Get instant information with Wikipedia summaries

🎤 Wake word detection (“Nova”) for activation

❌ Close running applications with a single command


🔹 Future Improvements

Enhance voice recognition accuracy in noisy environments

Add NLP for better understanding of natural commands

Integrate task automation (emails, reminders, etc.)

GUI version for better user experience
